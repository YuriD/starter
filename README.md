# Project starter

Use this project to start the angular/d3/bootstrap/nodejs app.

## Install and run 


		$cd node, npm install
      $node node/server.js

## Change it
The main business is under node/controller.js on the backend, and web/apps/changeme (js, html).
Change main.css to your heart's content, but namespace the css selectors for the application.
Only few touches in node/server.js and web/index.html needed.
